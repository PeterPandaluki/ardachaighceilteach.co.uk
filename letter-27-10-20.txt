Dear Sir/Madam,

I am developing a website which is intended to be a celebration of celtic culture. It will provide help to those wishing to study celtic languages, music, history and myths/legends, but will also provide information on places to visit, accommodation and travel.

At the moment, it is in an early stage. I find that I need some assistance in sourcing images in particular.

Would you be able to provide assistance such as relevant pictures and resources, or, possibly use the site to advertise? My feelings are that there will be increased interest in visiting when the coronavirus problem has become manageable.

The website address is:

www.ardachaighceilteach.co.uk



Yours,

Karl.
