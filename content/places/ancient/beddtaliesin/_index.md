### Taliesin's Grave  

Though there is no proof, the round cairn at [Bedd Taliesin](places/maps/wales/) is said to be the marker for the grave of the legendary 6th century poet, [Taliesin](folklore/folklor/wales/legends_wales/taliesin/). Local legend has it that after spending a night on the cairn, upon waking, the adventurous will become either a poet or insane.
