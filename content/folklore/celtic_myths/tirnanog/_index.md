Tir na nÓg is the name for the Celtic Otherworld, or, at least, one of them, and figures prominently in Irish mythology. It is an island paradise where one can gain immortality; the home of the **Tuatha Dé Danann**, warriors of the ancient gods, who seem to spend their time indulging in music, feasting and poetry.   

The name 'Tir na nÓg' means 'Land of the Young'.  

The island can be reached by water, either by travelling through a mist, going underwater or sailing for three days along the golden path of the setting sun's reflection on the ocean surface (the *Mag Mell*), or by entering a burial mound. It is dangerous for humans to remain on the island for a time which is a multiple of three days, months or years.
