## Gelert's Story

Many years ago, there was a prince of Eryri (roughly modern-day Snowdonia) who enjoyed hunting and kept a pack of hounds for the purpose. His name was Llewellyn. By far his most favoured companion was a dog called Gelert. Gelert was a large, handsome, loving and faithful dog - all of these, but above all he was trustworthy.
&nbsp; 


At this time, Prince Llewellyn, after years of waiting, had just been presented with an heir. He gathered all the local landowners for a celebration. As part of the celebration, the Prince had planned a hunt. On the day of the hunt, there came news of a large wolf in the area. Rather than cancel the hunt, the Prince decided to leave Gelert to protect his son and heir.
&nbsp;


It is not reported how well the hunt went, but when the Prince returned home, he was greeted by a blood-stained, limping Gelert, obviously pleased to see him. The Prince looked at the blood and suspected the worst. He ran to the nursery, followed by a happy Gelert. When he opened the door, the Price was devastated to see blood everywhere, shattered furniture and an up-turned cradle. There was no sign of his son. It was obvious that Gelert had killed the baby! The Prince let out a yell of despair, turned and plunged his sword into the surprised Gelert. 
&nbsp;


A servant ran, gasping, into the room. He had not been aware of the Prince's return. He told the Prince that Gelert had not left the baby's side at all while the Prince was away. The previous night, the wolf had come in through the nursery window. There had been an epic struggle but Gelert had won. He had saved the child's life. The servants, alerted by the noise, had burst into the room to find a wounded Gelert and a dead wolf. The baby was safe underneath the up-turned cradle. Realising his mistake and with tears in his eyes, the Prince knelt to support Gelert's head. But it was too late. Gelert's soft, gentle eyes closed as he gave up his life.
&nbsp;


The Prince had a special grave prepared in a field by the river, a field where Gelert often played. The grave is still there, marked by a stone. Bedd Gelert - Gelert's grave.
