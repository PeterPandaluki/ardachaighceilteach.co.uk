## The Phantom Dog of Gwrych Castle.  


Just inland from Abergele in North Wales, near the golf course, lies the beautiful Gwrych Castle nestling on the seaward slope of a gentle hill, its back to the woodlands. The castle can be approached via a modern A-road and there is an older road leading up to the castle itself. Once derelict, the castle has recently undergone renovation and is a lovely place to visit.  

In the 1930s, the area was much quieter than it is today, and it was at this time that a young Jim Taylor was riding his bicycle along the road past the castle walls. He has set out from Gronant early that morning as was heading to Old Colwyn.  

The weather was warm, the skies clear, and the sunshine bright. Jim was coming up to the castle walls at a leisurely pace when he sensed movement behind him. Galncing over his left shoulder, he saw that he was being folowed by a large black dog. Jim felt that there was something unusual about the dog, so he increased his speed. The dog kept up; indeed, it pulled alongside Jim, matching his pace. This continued for several hundred yards until Jim had passed the castle walls when the dog disappeared, as suddenly and quietly as it had appeared.  

Shaken, Jim continued his journey, but stopped at the next pub, where he reported that he had just been followed by a large dog as he passed Gwrych Castle walls. He was told there of a phantom dog and how it had followed travellers, always alone, in the past, only to disappear at the end of the castle walls.
