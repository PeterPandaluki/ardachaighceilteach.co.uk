## The Legend of the Seven Sisters. 


At the end of the nineteenth century, Britain was involved in several wars around the globe. Such military activity demanded manpower and it was common, in those days, for recruiting parties to tour the country, visiting the towns and villages. They would put on displays and play rousing music, attracting the attention of young adventure-spirited men, many of whom would dutifully and patriotically sign up for military service.  

Probably around the time of the Boer wars, it appears that one such recruiting party visited the small Welsh industrial town of Blaenau Ffestiniog in the heart of Snowdonia; many young men from the town volunteered. One family of seven sisters was particularly affected; each of the daughters had to bid goodbye to their husband or beau as they went off to war.  

Time passed and anxiety grew, but the sisters went about their daily business, each hoping desperately to see their man again, soon.  

After years of waiting, they eventually received word, but it was not encouraging. There had been a disaster for the British army - each of the seven men had been lost.  

Filled with despair, the sisters entered into a pact. The next full moon, they each went to Llyn Ffridd-y-bwlch, a small but deep lake among the slate mines. The night was cold and the frosty path glittered as they approached the dark waters of the lake. Together, they waded into the icy waters and drowned.   

Llyn Ffridd-y-bwlch can be seen on the right side of the road from the Crimea pass, entering Blaenau Ffestiniog, and it is said that, on clear nights of a full moon, the girls' voices can still be heard on the wind by any visitor brave enough to approach Llyn Ffridd-y-bwlch alone.
