### Shanachie  
A storyteller.  
All Celtic nations have a precious tradition of storytelling, a storytelling
that is not just the recitation of memorised tales but a poetic art in itself.
The shenache would relate histories, tales of daring and courage, magical epics
and tales of the Otherworld.  
Unforunately, this is a tradition which is fading.
