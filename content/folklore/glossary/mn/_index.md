### Mòd  

The Scottish Mòd is a gathering or celebration similar to the Welsh [Eisteddfod](/folklore/glossary/ef/). Local Mòds last only a day or two and usually end with a cèilidh with winners' presentations interspersed with music and dancing. Participants might tell stories, recite poetry, stage plays, perform dance, sing or play instruments. Of course, there is always bagpipe and fiddle music.  
Every year there is a National Mòd, <a href="https://www.ancomunn.co.uk/" target="_blank">Am Mòd Nàiseanta Rìoghail</a> , which lasts several days.

### The Morrigan  

One of the partners of **[The Dagda](folklore/glossary/cd/)**, and goddess of war, revenge, and fate.
