### The Ogham  
The Ogham is an alphabet, originally of 20 characters, which was used for markers, graves etc.. The earliest known use of ogham is in the first century CE. Each character is associated with a plant and, as such, each has spiritual meaning. (see [Celtic tree magic](/mysticism/celtictreemagic/))

### The Otherworld  
The spiritual dimension that exists parallel to the observed universe.  
The Otherworld pervades all. It is not only elsewhere but is within. We all
have access to the Otherworld through our inner being - our soul. The inherent
interconnectedness and all-pervading nature of the Otherworld is seen in the
symbolically interweaving visual metaphore of the celtic knot.
