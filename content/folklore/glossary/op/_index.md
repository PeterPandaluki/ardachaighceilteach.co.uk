### The Otherworld  
The spiritual dimension that exists parallel to the observed universe.  
The Otherworld pervades all. It is not only elsewhere but is within. We all
have access to the Otherworld through our inner being - our soul. The inherent
interconnectedness and all-pervading nature of the Otherworld is seen in the
interweaving visual metaphore of the celtic knot.
