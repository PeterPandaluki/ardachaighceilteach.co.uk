### The Dagda  

The Dagda is the leader of the **Tuatha dé Danann** and is the senior Celtic god or All-Father.  

Enormously strong, he could kill several men with one blow, but could also restore life with the other end of his club. His cauldron, further, provided an inexhaustible supply of food. By playing his harp, The Dagda could control the changing of the seasons.  

The Dagda was generally seen as a good god.
