### Avalon (Ynys Afallon - The Isle of Apple Trees)  

The mystical island to which King Arthur was taken after the battle of **Camlann**.  

The name "Avalon" is probably derived from the old brythonic word for fruit (or apple) trees - *avellen*. There is a similarity with an old goidelic name for the Otherworld - *Emain Ablach* (the Isle of Apple Trees) - this is consistent with the brythonic view that Arthur did not die but passed to the Otherworld, and will return in times of need.  

Many consider that **Glastonbury Tor**, a prominent feature of the Somerset plain fp , is the site of Avalon; at the time of Arthur, the tor would indeed have been an island surrounded marsh and wetlands, not the beautiful farmland of today.
