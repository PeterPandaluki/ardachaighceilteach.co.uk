### Lugh Lámhfada  
Lugh Lámhfada, Lugh of the Long Hand, is a senior Irish god and patron of the arts and crafts, and a member of the **Tuatha Dé Danann**.  
Following Christian conversion of Ireland, Lugh Lámhfada was demoted by Christian scribes and his name anglicised to "Leprechaun" (a pispronunciation of "Lugh-chromain").
